# Income_vs_Pollution
An attempt to use linear regression and US income data to predict pollution levels at US county level.

This project provides a good example of cleaning and prepping data, especially for the income dataset.

The 'USIncome_vs_Pollution.ipynb' hasn't been rendering properly in git, I believe this is related to a known issue.
I've provided an html vesion of the file ('USIncome_vsPollution.html'), download it to view in your browser. 
Images of project output including visualizations are embedded.

If you'd like to run the project, first download all code and data, leave the data directory and sub-directories as they are, 
but unzip the pollution_us_2000_2016.zip in the data/USPollution directory.

This project has been parked in its current state, but I do have plans to find better pollution data for all counties 
and improve the methods used to aggregate the pollution data.
